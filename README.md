For this assignment, I used pie charts to compare my screentime divided among apps on my phone. I used pandas and a Jupuyter notebook to code the charts.

## Day 2: Pictogram
![...](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/DataVis1/blob/main/pictogram.png)

This assignment was to create a pictogram. I chose to represent the number of items in my closet by type (tops, bottoms, accessories, outerwear, and shoes). This is per my most recent count, which was the end of last spring. Each season I log all of the items in my closet and atempt to track the frequency of each item worn. I was not very consitent in tracking that last fall but I do have a near perfect consistency logging my clothing from last Spring and it's great to have a chance to use that data (link to data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0-v3ouY4rN1e4tSHUbPqobK7eeLLzmpLQm02g24KoE/edit?usp=sharing). I used a tutorial from Towards Data Science (link found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/2-efficient-ways-of-creating-fancy-pictogram-charts-in-python-8b77d361d500)) and the pywaffle documentation (link found [here](https://pywaffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to create this pictogram using a jupyter notebook and python (jupyter notebook found [here](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/DataVis1/blob/main/DataVis%20Pictogram%20(1).ipynb)). I could've used a more simle program like a pictogram creator online but I wanted more control. Even though it did not go perfectly, I still had a lot of choice with the set up and color choices. I tried my very best to use clothing icons but none of them were working with my code so eventually, at around 2:00 am, I gave up and settled on more basic icons. In the future I would like to learn how to use to more advanced icons in pywaffles but.

This assignemnt was to create another pictogram. This time I compared the amount of items worn and not worn for each type of item in my closet (tops, bottoms, shoes, outerwear, accessories). I used the same data from the last assignemnt (link to data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0-v3ouY4rN1e4tSHUbPqobK7eeLLzmpLQm02g24KoE/edit?usp=sharing)). I used a tutorial from Towards Data Science (link found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/2-efficient-ways-of-creating-fancy-pictogram-charts-in-python-8b77d361d500)) and the pywaffle documentation (link found [here](https://pywaffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to create this pictogram using a jupyter notebook and python (jupyter notebook found [here](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/DataVis1/blob/main/DataVis%20Pictogram2.ipynb)). 

## Day 4: Historical Comparison

This assignment was to make a historical comparison. I used the sleep data from my garmin watch, a matplotlib tutorial (link [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/barchart.html)) and a jupyter notebook 
(found [here](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/DataVis1/blob/main/HistoricalComparison%20.ipynb)). 

## Day 5: Magical Comparison

This assignment was to make a "Magical Comparison", the guidelines were pretty broad so I decided to chart data about the number one thing that comes to mind when I think of Magic, Harry Potter. This is a histogram comparing box office revenue between the 8 movies.
