For this assignment, I used pie charts to compare my screentime divided among apps on my phone. I used pandas and a Jupuyter notebook to code the charts.

## Day 2: Pictogram

This assignment was to create a pictogram. I chose to represent the number of items in my closet by type (tops, bottoms, accessories, outerwear, and shoes). This is per my most recent count, which was the end of last spring. Each season I log all of the items in my closet and atempt to track the frequency of each item worn. I was not very consitent in tracking that last fall but I do have a near perfect consistency logging my clothing from last Spring and it's great to have a chance to use that data. I used a tutorial from Towards Data Science (link found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/2-efficient-ways-of-creating-fancy-pictogram-charts-in-python-8b77d361d500)) and the pywaffle documentation (link found [here](https://pywaffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to create this pictogram using a jupyter notebook and python (jupyter notebook found [here](https://github.com/natasha-muromceww/DataVis1/blob/main/DataVis%20Pictogram%20(1).ipynb)). I could've used a more simle program like a pictogram creator online but I wanted more control. Even though it did not go perfectly, I still had a lot of choice with the set up and color choices. I tried my very best to use clothing icons but none of them were working with my code so eventually, at around 2:00 am, I gave up and settled on more basic icons. In the future I would like to learn how to use to more advanced icons in pywaffles but.
